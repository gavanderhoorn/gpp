Basic Installation
==================

Typical CMake style build:

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

On Windows systems (with Visual Studio installed) using the 'NMake Makefiles'
generator is easiest. The procedure then becomes:

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" ..
  nmake

In all cases the binary will be placed in the 'build/src' directory.
